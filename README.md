# Search_Engines_Privacy

Welcome to the Search Engines Privacy Analysis repository! This repository encompasses a comprehensive analysis of search engine privacy. Our project involves crawling five prominent search engines, namely Google, Bing, StartPage, DuckDuckGo, and Qwant. The crawling process entails initiating search queries, detecting search results and advertisements on the search engine results page, interacting with displayed advertisements, and accessing their landing URLs. For each crawling instance, our web driver captures the corresponding search query, displayed advertisements, and all network requests sent by the browser. Furthermore, we have developed mechanisms to detect tracking requests using the EasyPrivacy and EasyList tracking lists. Lastly, we evaluate instances of bounce tracking and UID smuggling upon clicking on advertisements, assessing the privacy implications of using different search engines.


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three top-level directories:

1. **Crawling System:** This directory contains Puppeteer-based crawlers implemented in an object-oriented manner. It also stores the results of the crawling process for various search engines.

2. **Trackers Detection:** Here you'll find the `add_is_tracker.py` script, which identifies network requests that are potentially tracking requests. The script uses Adblock rules to make this determination and generates a JSON file containing tracking information.

3. **Analysis:** This directory holds the data sources used for analysis, the JSON file generated by the tracking detection script, a Jupyter notebook file (`analysis.ipynb`) that performs detailed analysis, and the resulting tables and plots.
